# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Basically, A web app using React, fastAPI and ML.I split this work into two parts: Web app and ML. Firstly, I trained a ML model with davis dataset, using height, weight, sex AND saved the model as pkl format. After that, loaded the trained model into main.py in fastapi2 folder to predict weight according to input that client does, then show prediction at frontside. 

1: Train a model: Machine learning

2: Predict and show the result, using React <=====> FastAPI 

2024/06/25 update:
Have modified front side such as columns.

2024/06/26 update:
Created Minimum Viable Product in dev branch.

Going to do.
To train a new lightGBM model with larger, Japanese specific and more columns data.
