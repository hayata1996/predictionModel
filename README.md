# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Basically, React, fastAPI and mysql. Hopefully, I will add ML component and bind them together.

React <=====> FastAPI <======> MySQL (<======> Machine learning)
